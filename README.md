## Introduction

The C++ Programming Concepts repository is designed to provide simple, categorized C++ programs that focus on fundamental to advanced concepts of C++ programming. Each folder in the repository covers a specific topic, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming, exception handling, and more. The goal is to help learners strengthen their understanding of C++ step by step, with real code examples and practice exercises.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **BASICS**: Programs covering basic C++ syntax and concepts like variables, input/output, and data types.
- **CONDITIONALS**: Examples of `if`, `else`, `else if` statements and decision-making in C++.
- **DERIVED_DATATYPES/ARRAYS**: Programs covering arrays, derived data types, and their usage.
- **EXCEPTION HANDLING**: Programs demonstrating how to handle exceptions in C++.
- **FILE HANDLING**: Examples of file input/output in C++.
- **FUNCTIONS**: Programs demonstrating function usage, including user-defined and built-in functions.
- **JUMPING STATEMENTS**: Examples of `break`, `continue`, and `goto` statements.
- **LOOPS**: Programs covering `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **OOPS**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **POINTERS**: Programs explaining pointers and memory management.
- **PRACTICE**: Various practice problems to enhance coding skills.
- **STAR PROGRAMS**: Examples of programs to print patterns using stars.
- **START**: Initial setup and introductory programs for getting started with C++.
- **STL**: Standard Template Library examples, including vectors, stacks, and other containers.
- **SWITCH CASE**: Programs using `switch` statements for multiple-choice logic.
- **USER_DEFINED_DATATYPES**: Examples covering structures, unions, and other user-defined data types.

## Requirements

To run the C++ programs in this repository, you need the following:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Code::Blocks)

## Usage

To run any of the C++ programs in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arya-io/cpp-basics.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cpp-basics
3. Navigate to the folder of your choice (e.g., BASICS, LOOPS):
   ```bash
   cd BASICS
4. Compile the desired C++ file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
5. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output
Replace `filename.cpp` with the name of the C++ file you want to compile and run.
